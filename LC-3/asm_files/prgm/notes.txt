    * bin_manip.asm
        Takes strings of binary from user and performs bitwise operations on them
        
    * dec_to_bin.asm
        Takes in a signed 5 digit decimal number and prints the corresponding binary version

prgm/small/

    * print_rev.asm
        Takes in chars from user saves to array, then prints array in reverse order
