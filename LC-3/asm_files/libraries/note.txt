LC3 Subroutine Libraies
-----------------------
- Bitwise -> {OR, XOR, NOR, XNOR}
- Math    -> {SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD} 

SUBROUTINE SYNTAX:
---------------------
R1: SUBROUTINE POINTER
R2: VARIABLE A
R3: VARIABLE B
R4: RESULT

What this means:
- "Return values" are to be expected in register R4
- computation will happen mostly in registers R4, R5, and R6
- register R7 is used for return address only
- for math routines numbers are 16 bit 2's compliment integers
    
*** IMPORTANT ***
- These libraries are probably not portable.
- They are presented as is (may contain defects, etc...)
- Don't expect any values to be preserved in their registers (only returns goto R4)
- Currently most of the routines don't backup anything except the return address
- Don't expect error checking
- etc
