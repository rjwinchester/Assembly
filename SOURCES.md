As a side note, both of these projects were developed by Randal Hyde.
HLA is a more developed replacement of the ucr stblib.
They both have a standard library, shell, and high level macros to make coding easier.

Note a very unique thing about HLA:  
Carefully written (console) applications will compile and run on all supported operating systems without change.
