0217     "Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our
0217      sorrows; yet we considered him stricken by God,
0217      smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for
0217      our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities;

0821     "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a
0821      shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the
0821      trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
0821      Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught
0821      up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord
0821      in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord."
0821                          I Thessalonians 4:16,17
0822     "For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord
0822      so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall
0822      say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh
0822      upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and
0822      they shall not escape."      I Thessalonians 5:2,3
0823     "For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
0823      salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, Who died for us,
0823      that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live
0823      together with him."
0823                         I Thessalonians 5:9,10
0824     "I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the
0824      Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to
0824      the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before
0824      him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and
0824      a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages,
0824      should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting
0824      dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom
0824      that which shall not be destroyed."

0825     "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the
0825      night. The heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
0825      and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the
0825      earth and the works that are therein shall be burned
0825      up."                     II Peter 3:10
0826     "Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved,
0826      what manner of persons ought ye to be? You ought to
0826      live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the
0826      day of God and speed its coming."

0827     "But the end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore
0827      sober, and watch unto prayer. And above all things
0827      have fervent love among yourselves; for love shall
0827      cover the multitude of sins."      I Peter 4:7,8

0829     "Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season;

0829      doctrine."          II Timothy 4:2
0830     "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the
0830      whole world, and lose his own soul?"      Mark 8:36
0831     " ...Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a man's

0831      which he possesseth."       Luke 12:15
0901     "For in much wisdom is much grief; and he that
0901      increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow."

0902     "But God said to him, You fool! This very night your
0902      soul is required of you; and now who will own what you
0902      have prepared? So is the man who lays up treasure for
0902      himself, and is not rich toward God."

0903     "And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto
0903      you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat;
0903      neither for the body, what ye shall put on. For life
0903      is more than meat, and the body is more than clothing.
0903      Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap;
0903      they have neither storehouse nor barn; and yet God
0903      feeds them;  how much better you are than the birds!
0903      Consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil
0903      not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that
0903      Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
0903      these. If then God so clothe the grass, which is to
0903      day in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the oven;
0903      how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little
0903      faith?  And seek not what ye shall eat, or what ye
0903      shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.
0903      But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these
0903      things shall be added unto you."

0905     "He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded
0905      us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is
0905      high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward
0905      them that fear him. As far as the east is from the
0905      west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from
0905      us."     Psalms 103:10-12
0906     "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man

0918      measure it will be measured to in return."

0921      be highminded nor trust in uncertain riches, but in
0921      the living God, who giveth us richly all things to
0921      enjoy; That they do good, that they be rich in good
0921      works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
0921      Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation
0921      against the time to come, that they may lay hold on

0922     "Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a
0922      trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the
0922      synagogues and in the streets, that they may have
0922      glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their
0922      reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left
0922      hand know what thy right hand doeth; That thine alms
0922      may be in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret
0922      himself shall reward thee openly."       Matthew 6:2-4

0925      or nakedness, or peril, or sword?...But in all these

0926      things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor
0926      any other created thing, shall be able to separate us

0930      trial which is to try you, as though some strange
0930      thing happened unto you; But rejoice, inasmuch as ye
0930      are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his
0930      glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with
0930      exceeding joy."       I Peter 4:12,13
0930     "If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are

1003      God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,
1003      holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
1003      service. And be not conformed to this world; but be ye
1003      transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may

1004      sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the
1004      dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints
